# CLI / HTTP client for myDATA

This project allows users to interact with [myDATA](https://www.aade.gr/en/mydata)
("my Digital Accounting and Tax Application") either via a Python HTTP client or
from the CLI.

## Install

Install it with `pip`:

```
python -m pip install mydata-client
```

## Usage

> Oh, you may also find the docs a bit... lacking :grimacing:

If you want to interact programmatically with myDATA's API, you can use the HTTP
client under `mydata/client.py`. The Python dataclasses that bind to XML
documents can be found in the `mydata/models*` modules, depending on which
version of the API you want to use.

There is also a proof-of-concept CLI that you can use:

```
mydata --username <username> <command>
```

There are two command groups that you can invoke:

* The `api` command group, which is unopinionated and straight up hits the
  endpoint that you ask.
* The `invoice` command group, which is heavily opinionated and adds some helper
  commands to work with invoices. Basically, it's there to assist the list ->
  retrieve -> copy -> edit -> validate -> send lifecycle of an invoice.

## Building

Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Then, install the project
dependencies:

```
poetry install
```

### Adding new XSD schemas

Whenever there's an API update, myDATA devs include the XML schemas for the
latest API. You can include them in the project as follows:

* Add the XML schemas under `schemas/<version>` dir. For example, for the 1.0.8
  XSDs, we added them with:

  ```
  cp -r '/path/to/version v1.0.8 XSDs' schemas/1.0.8
  ```

* Remove the previously generated `mydata/__init__.py` module:

  ```
  rm mydata/__init__.py
  ```

* Generate Python classes from the new XSDs. For example, for the 1.0.8 XSDs, we
  generated Python classes with:


  ```
  poetry run xsdata -ss single-package -ds Google -r schemas/1.0.8/ -p mydata.models_v1_0_8
  ```

* Generate Markdown documentation from the generated Python classes with:

  ```
  poetry run pydoc-markdown -m mydata.models_v1_0_8 --render-toc > docs/models_v1_0_8.md
  ```
